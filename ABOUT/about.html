A native son of Cape Town I spent my formative years at Rondebosch Boys' Preparatory School and High School respectively. Since those early years I've wanted to pursue a career in science which I narrowed down to engineering and finally mechatronics. It's multidisciplinary nature and exponentially growing scope fascinated me. Of course, the release of Iron Man in 2007 certainly didn't diminish the appeal.  
 <br/><br/>
I am an engineer through and through, excelling in logical and deductive thinking as well as analytical reasoning. I have a passion for problem solving (like any aspiring engineer) but consider my interests and skillset diverse. I have strong interests in writing as well as film &amp; media. I worked for a number of years as a core member at one of SA's biggest gaming websites, EGMR, and through this I gained invaluable experience. I learnt how to manage people, employ critical thinking, express myself and, perhaps most importantly, be a functional part of something bigger than myself.

    I started in high school as an author out of a love for wrting and gaming.I rapidly started taking on more responsibility as time went on and my position within the team solidified. It has since grown into a real job, wherein articles must be proofread, scheduled and edited, games must be assigned each month, writers need to be kept happy and distributors need to be liased with in order to secure review samples. This in addition to writing several articles daily. As a senior member of staff I was also involved in undertaking a rebranding and restructuring of the site in 2013. I was with EGMR up until its closure in early 2016 and in that time developed a valuable skllset which can be applied in any workplace environment.

I have a keen interest in analysing film and media (including games) and consider this passion a core part of who I am. As the oldest in a family of boys my mother wsted no time in domesticating me and out of this came a passion for baking. Peanut butter, Oreos and cinnamon are my primary weapons here along with a general disregard for what the recipe says.

Conversely, I'm and avid cyclist and had the great experience of participating in the 2014 Argus Cycle Tour.

 <br/><br/>
I consider myself goal-driven and experimental. The former is no more clearly evidenced than by singular focus fornear-on a decade to become mechatronics engineer. The latter is meanwhile exhibited in my loose approach to following recipes when baking, instead trying out new and different twists. I live by the philosophy that I will never not make mistakes but will never stop seeking to better myself.
