          <h5><strong>A Bit About Me</strong></h5>
<p>
I am an engineer through and through, excelling in logical and deductive thinking as well as analytical reasoning. I have a passion for problem solving (like any aspiring engineer) but consider my interests and skillset diverse. 
I consider myself goal-driven and experimental. I live by the philosophy that I will never not make mistakes but will never stop seeking to better myself.
If, by some small miracle, you're not two seconds away from closing this page then feel free to find out more about me in the, uhm... ABOUT ME section.

          <h5><strong>Vision</strong></h5>
<p>
From an extremely young age I've had a passion for technology, science and understanding how things work. In high school I was introduced to the field of mechatronics and instantly knew that this was the direction I wanted to steer my life in. 
I've worked with the singular and focused vision of a career at the cutting edge of engineering and robotics. Once attained, I intend to do my utmost to live out my life doing what I love and doing something of value.
