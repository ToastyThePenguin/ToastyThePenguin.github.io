The final hurdle in my undergrad studies was a semester long research project culminating in a report upon which my chances of graduating rested. My chosen topic was multiple moving target tracking with a focus on the tracking of small, fast-moving objects. 
        <br/><br/>
        Object tracking is scarcely a new field of study in the realm of computer vision. As such there is no shortage of available generic tracking algorithms however, the task of tracking multiple objects is still very much open-ended. Furthermore, many investigations into this problem focus on human targets and neglect to deal with variable lighting or occlusion. A niche thus exists in algorithms that focus on the tracking of small, fast-moving objects and similarly suited datasets for testing these algorithms. This study aims to address that. The research presented here and any fruits yielded will contribute towards an initial study into bat tracking and counting being conducted by the UCT Zoology Department.</p>

I started at EGMR in high school, a fresh-faced teen with a passion for writing at a new site eager to take on fresh blood. It quickly became something I devoted more and more of my extra time to. Before I knew it, it was a part-time job and one which I poured time and effort into. I saw the site grow in parallel with my own skills.
<br/><br/>
Why is this part of my portfolio when it has nothing to do with engineering? Good question. EGMR was a massive part of my life and a big contributor to my process of maturation.
